# Rapid Prototyping Lab - Summer 2022

Howdy folks!!
Welcome to RPL or Rapid Prototyping Lab.

Here are some links and instructions to help you around.

## Getting Started

Checkout this page here. [www.github.com/AD-SDL](AD-SDL)

## Slack
We will invite you to our slack workspace. Please let us know if you have not been invited. 

## Github
We recommend these tutorials if you are new to git: 

- [https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc)

Please do not add large files to git repositories if possible. 
* Please ask your supervisor where to put them. 
* Please do not clone a git repository in a directory that is synced with icloud or any other sync mechanism, as files might be deleted.

### Process for Github:
- Fork the https://github.com/AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2022 repository.  
  - This will create a “copy” of the repository in your own profile.  (ex. https://github.com/ravescovi/rpl-summer-2022)
- Clone forked repository to your machine (ex. git clone git@github.com:ravescovi/rpl-summer-2022.git)
- Make code changes on the main (or another branch) in your own forked environment (i.e git commit)
- Push your changes to your own forked repository (git push origin <branch>)
- Then within your fork on github create a “Pull Request”

- You will see that the proposed merge is from ravescovi/rpl-summer-2022:main -> AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2022:main.  Click “Create pull request”

- After the change is approved, click the “Merge pull request”.  This will merge your change into the `AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2022:main along with everyone else’s work in a safe way.

- Repeat the above process for each change you want to make.


> *note:* your own fork will get “out-of-date” with the main AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2022 repository so in your forked repository in GitHub you can click the “Fetch upstream” to have the upstream repository merged into your fork. (see attached image)

## Daily blogs
This is a space to keep your daily blogs and maintain a `README.md` with links to resources that may be shared using non-Git avenues. 
- Create a folder named per your name. 
- Copy the daily_log_template.md and rename it to README.md
- Update the info on the log
